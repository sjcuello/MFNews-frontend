## Considerations
This app is built with a modern React setup, using:
- Redux to manage the appâ€™s state in a predictable way.
- Redux Thunk for handling async actions like API calls.
- Material-UI for clean, responsive UI components and styling.
- Yup to validate forms easily and reliably.
- React Router to handle navigation between pages.
- CSS Modules for scoped, maintainable styles.
- TypeScript for better code quality and type safety.
- Vite as the fast and modern build tool for development.
##### Pages
- Home page: Displays all articles available in the feed. You can click on an article to view its details, edit it, or delete it.
- Article details page: Displays the details of a specific article.
- Add/Edit Article: using a Drawer component to add or edit an article.
- Trash bin: Displays a deleted articles list that can be restored or permanently deleted.
- Error page: Displays a message when the user navigates to an invalid route.
